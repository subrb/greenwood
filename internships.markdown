Greenwood believes that the best part of an internship is that it teaches a young person about a specific industry and company. Investing in internships help students succeed in their first job and sets them up for long-term career success, extending the value of their college degree.

The internship program is an intensive ten-week program culminating with a shark tank style pitch competition and funded brokerage account. Greenwood Scholars also participate in lunch and learn sessions with various employers in Chicago; visit NYC for an annual Wall Street Tour; and participate in other industry relevant events.

Greenwood's Summer Internship Program combines three weeks of academic instruction at DePaul University followed by seven weeks of real-world experience at a leading financial firm.  It is intensive, immersive and an incredible opportunity to explore a career in finance and investment as part of a supportive community.

Applicants must be in attendance for the entire length of the program in order to be considered.

Training workshops educate Scholars on all facets of the professional world from how to dress and speak to building a professional resume. Continuing education helps Scholars attain domain knowledge in the finance industry.

Scholars make a final presentation at the end of the internship.
