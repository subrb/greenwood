Greenwood believes that the best part of an internship is that it teaches a young person about a specific industry and company. Investing in internships help students succeed in their first job and sets them up for long-term career success, extending the value of their college degree.

#### PROGRAM DETAILS
 
*   The internship program runs June through August.
*   Training workshops educate Scholars on all facets of the professional world from how to dress and speak to building a professional resume.
*   Continuing education helps Scholars attain domain knowledge in the finance industry.
*   Corporate partners, with Greenwoodâ€™s guidance, develop detailed work programs for the Scholar to maximize the effectiveness of their time with the partner.
*   Scholars shadow specific employees and develop a mentor-mentee relationship that has, thus far, lasted well beyond the internship.
*   Scholars make a final presentation to Greenwood staff demonstrating what they've learned in their internship.
