Greenwood believes that the best part of an internship is that it teaches a young person about a specific industry and company. Investing in internships help students succeed in their first job and sets them up for long-term career success, extending the value of their college degree.

In its first two years, the Greenwood Project brought about immediate and high impact change with its programs. Perhaps the most impactful experience for students has been the real-world exposure they have gotten to the financial industry. Greenwood has also left a lasting impression on our partner firms.

#### PROGRAM DETAILS

*   The internship program runs June through August.
*   Training workshops educate Scholars on all facets of the professional world from how to dress and speak to building a professional resume.
*   Continuing education helps Scholars attain domain knowledge in the finance industry.
*   Corporate partners, with Greenwoodâ€™s guidance, develop detailed work programs for the Scholar to maximize the effectiveness of their time with the partner.
*   Scholars shadow specific employees and develop a mentor-mentee relationship that has, thus far, lasted well beyond the internship.
*   Scholars make a final presentation to Greenwood staff demonstrating what they've learned in their internship.
