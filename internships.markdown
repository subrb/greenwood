In its first two years, the Greenwood Project brought about immediate and high impact change with its programs. Perhaps the most impactful experience for students has been the real-world exposure they have gotten to the financial industry. Greenwood has also left a lasting impression on our partner firms.

#### PROGRAM DETAILS

*   The internship program runs June through August.
*   Training workshops educate Scholars on all facets of the professional world from how to dress and speak to building a professional resume.
*   Continuing education helps Scholars attain domain knowledge in the finance industry.
*   Corporate partners, with Greenwoodâ€™s guidance, develop detailed work programs for the Scholar to maximize the effectiveness of their time with the partner.
*   Scholars shadow specific employees and develop a mentor-mentee relationship that has, thus far, lasted well beyond the internship.
*   Greenwood Scholars are paid as hourly employees by the foundation, remuneration also includes transportation and attire costs.
*   Scholars make a final presentation to the Greenwood team which must explain what their corporate sponsor does, how they do it, and why the company adds value to the economy.
