**Virtual Programming Offerings**

Historically, the Greenwood Project has hosted live events, internships, and other programming for students each summer. With the onset of COVID-19, we have worked hard to bring all of our programming online.

**Virtual Career Talks**

Live networking events have, historically, been a significant part of any Greenwood Scholar’s experience. Since we can no longer meet industry professionals in their offices, we have partnered with William Blair to move these online. About once a week, we bring professionals together for a presentation or panel discussion about the finance industry. While these were, historically, only open to Greenwood Scholars, we are now making these available to any high school or college student interested in the finance industry.

**Virtual Financial Certification Programs**

This is a new program, born out of our desire to continue supporting students during COVID-19. Especially now, we want to help students build an extremely strong resume. We want them to stand out when hiring resumes at financial corporations. So, we launched a program called “Investing in the Future of Finance” that offers scholarships for students to take entry-level financial certification exams.

* CFA Institute Investment Foundations

* Securities Industry Essentials® (SIE®).

**Virtual Career Readiness & Finance Industry Courses**

Each summer, the Greenwood Project hosts institutes for those Greenwood Scholars who are not taking on an internship. These were conducted live over the course of several weeks. We have now moved this program online. While this was, historically, only open to Greenwood Scholars, we are now making these available to any high school or college student interested in the finance industry. When we are able to go back to our full, in-person program, we hope that some of the non-Greenwood Project students who took these courses will be interested in pursuing our internship program. To encourage participation, we have offered a rewards program for students.
