VIRTUAL PROGRAMMING OFFERINGS

Historically, the Greenwood Project has hosted live events, internships, and other programming for students
each summer. With the onset of COVID-19, we have worked hard to bring all of our programming online.

VIRTUAL CAREER TALKS

Live networking events have, historically, been a
significant part of any Greenwood Scholar’s
experience. Since we can no longer meet industry
professionals in their offices, we have partnered with
William Blair to move these online. About once a
week, we bring professionals together for a
presentation or panel discussion about the finance
industry. While these were, historically, only open to
Greenwood Scholars, we are now making these
available to any high school or college student
interested in the finance industry.

VIRTUAL FINANCIAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS

This is a new program, born out of our desire to
continue supporting students during COVID-19.
Especially now, we want to help students build an
extremely strong resume. We want them to stand out
when hiring resumes at financial corporations. So, we
launched a program called “Investing in the Future of
Finance” that offers scholarships for students to take
entry-level financial certification exams. Exams:
Bloomberg BMC, CFA Institute Investment Foundations,
Securities Industry Essentials® (SIE®).

VIRTUAL CAREER READINESS & FINANCE INDUSTRY COURSES

Each summer, the Greenwood Project hosts institutes for
those Greenwood Scholars who are not taking on an
internship. These were conducted live over the course of
several weeks. We have now moved this program online.
While this was, historically, only open to Greenwood
Scholars, we are now making these available to any high
school or college student interested in the finance industry.
When we are able to go back to our full, in-person program,
we hope that some of the non-Greenwood Project students
who took these courses will be interested in pursuing our
internship program. To encourage participation, we have
offered a rewards program for students
