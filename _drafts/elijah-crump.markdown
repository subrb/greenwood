My name is Elijah Crump and I am a Junior at Knox College where I major in Integrative Business and Management. On campus, I am recognized as an athlete on the men’s basketball team as well as a peer career leader in the career services office. I’m also involved with our black student Union which is what actually connected me to the Greenwood Project.

I met a former alumni of Knox and of the Greenwood project in the summer of 2019 at a Knox black alumni event and he told me he’d be my reference for applying. Before Finance my primary focus was marketing and in my mind that was the path I was headed but in that summer of 2019, I got into investing. I started doing a lot of my own research and got more serious about finance once the opportunity to join the Greenwood project was brought to my attention. As I was doing my research I started to realize that this is something that I enjoyed and I started rethinking my career goals. One thing I’ve always wanted to do is give back to people who look like me and come from where I come from and what better way than enhancing their financial literacy. I figured that I can take what I learn from finance and cycle that back into black and brown communities because that’s something that we’re not taught. 

With that being said, I can say that joining the Greenwood project was the best thing I could have done. Not only have I been enhancing my financial literacy and learning everyday, I’ve also been getting to connect and talk with many leaders in the financial industry. Greenwood has given me the opportunity to have leaders in the financial industry as resources for when I need guidance and to me that is irreplaceable. Currently I handle weekly rotational projects assigned by financial firms such as William Blair, Headwater solutions, and Chicago Trading company.
