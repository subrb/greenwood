My name is Myles McNeal. I am a rising senior at Mount Carmel High School, located on the southside of Chicago. At Mount Carmel, I am a leader of our Multicultural Club, a member of our Investment Club, and captain of our Varsity Lacrosse Team.

I am grateful to be a part of the Greenwood Project for a second year, and I can say this was one of the best summers I've ever had. After being accepted, I thought I already knew what to expect, but I was sorely mistaken. For one, it was great to see the progress that I made as well as the new Greenwood Project interns, and I can tell that everyone learned something new this year. I participated in two significant projects that I would join again if I had the chance. The first being a project given to us by William Blair, where we had to create a pipeline program for unrepresented minority students and their relationship with the financial industry. The second was a stock pitch competition where my team pitched to individuals in the financial sector.

The Greenwood Project continues to support and educate minority students, and I am genuinely appreciative of that. If it's not introducing students to careers in the finance and fintech industry, the Greenwood Project helps students connect with guest speakers so they can have a continuing relationship. I know for a fact that my future will be bright, and that is all thanks to the Greenwood Project. I will be part of the Greenwood Project for years to come!
