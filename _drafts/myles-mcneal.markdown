My name is Myles McNeal and I am a rising senior at Mount Carmel High School, located on the southside of Chicago. At Mount Carmel, I am a leader of our multicultural club, a member of our investment club, and captain of our varsity lacrosse team.

I am grateful to be a part of the greenwood for a second year, and I can say this was one of the best summers I’ve ever had. After being accepted I thought I already knew what to expect, but I was sorely mistaken. For one it was really great to see the progress that I made as well as the new greenwood project interns, and I can tell that everyone learned something new this year. I was also able to participate in two major projects that I had a great time working on. The first being a project given to us by William Blair where we had to create a pipeline program for unrepresented minority students and their relationship with the financial industry. The second being a stock pitch competition where my team pitched to a group of individuals in the financial industry.


 The Greenwood Project continues to support and educate minority students and I am truly appreciative of that. If it’s not introducing students to careers in the finance and fintech industry, the Greenwood Project helps students connect with guest speakers so they can have a continuing relationship. I know for a fact my future will be bright and that is all thanks to the Greenwood project. I will definitely be involved with the Greenwood Project for years to come!
