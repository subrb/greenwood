My name is Joshua Jones I’m a rising senior in Rich Township High School. At Rich township I am a part of a few clubs, first is the Chess club where I learn the many different strategies to play chess. There is also the Technology club where I build my own vex robot from scratch and control them using a controller. You can also do some coding on the robots by using additional tools on them so you can do some extra things with them like making them move differently.  In the month of November, I had the chance to apply for the Greenwood Project’s Fintech program.

I found out about the Greenwood Project from my sister who recommended this to me. I’ve always had an interest in Technology and coding mostly because I heard that you can make videos game using coding. I participated in a few coding programs, I went to a program at my middle school, I was also in a program at blue studios where I learned a little bit about different coding languages. I wasn’t really good at coding at that time because those programs wasn’t the best so this was a good opportunity for me to learn more finance, stocks, and different coding languages. All in all I really like this program, I learned a lot about coding, and little bit about finance, and stock. It even helped me get little better at public speaking because of all the career talks we have.
