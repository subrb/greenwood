My name is Leslie Esquivel. I am a rising Senior at John Hancock College Preparatory with a passion for math and technology. After taking multiple computer science courses and my summer with the Greenwood Project, I aspire to pursue a career in the engineering field, notably Computer Science.

My school only has a limited amount of computer science classes; thus, while searching for a more significant opportunity to advance my knowledge and skills in computer science and its languages, a classmate recommended me to research the Greenwood Project. After learning the Greenwood Project's mission and about its Fintech track for high school students, I was determined to get into their Fintech Internship. I was ecstatic the moment I received the news that I got accepted, and regardless of the pandemic, the Greenwood Project would continue virtually. 

Greenwood has opened various opportunities for me. I began my internship this summer with only the knowledge of one programming language, JavaScript. I left knowing two additional languages, Python and R. I can apply these languages in my career to solve financial problems such as the analysis of stocks. The Greenwood Project also demonstrated the importance of a good resume and professional etiquette, leading me to create an outstanding resume after various workshops.

I gained knowledge in computer science languages; I was also introduced into the world of finance. I entered with minimal experience in stocks and investing and managed to understand the importance of analyzing stocks and different investing forms. I learned about careers where finance and computer science are combined, allowing me to understand all the available opportunities for me once I earn my degree in college. 

Finally, I have ended my summer with strong principles that would not have been possible without Greenwood. Regardless of the situation or the people around me, I can be successful as long as I remain motivated, confident, and driven to succeed in my chosen field. I am thankful for all the career talk speakers for elaborating on these principals. Special thanks to Bevon Joseph, the President of Greenwood, who allowed me to participate in this fantastic opportunity.
