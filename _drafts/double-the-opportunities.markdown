My name is Fatima Gutierrez and I am a rising Junior at Bradley University double majoring in Management and Leadership and Management Information System-Business Analytics with a minor in Spanish.

I first heard about the Greenwood Project during my freshman year at Bradley. I was reading the flyer posted on the wall while waiting for the elevators and I saw two words “Minority” and “Internships.” That was the moment I knew I had to look into this company.  Later in spring, I was able to meet Bevon Joseph, the Co-founder and President of Greenwood, at our spring career fair where I learned more about the Greenwood Project’s values and mission. Although I did not apply that summer, I always kept them in mind and later applied my sophomore year for Summer 2020. 

The Greenwood Project has been the best thing that has ever happened to me this summer. I have learned so much about networking, options trading, portfolio management, mortgage rates, stock investing, and the list goes on and on. Thanks to the Greenwood Project I have also been able to obtain my Bloomberg Market Concepts (BMC) Certification, study for my CFA Investment Foundation Certification, and learn how to use the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Greenwood Project also gave me the opportunity to obtain an internship at Northwestern Mutual-Chicago as an operations intern. I have had a great time learning about the company culture and meeting new people- an experience that has been amazing even through Zoom calls. I have enjoyed working on various projects and witnessing everything it takes for a company to operate effectively. I have been able to work closely and receive mentorship from Tara O’Dea who has been there to challenge me and guide me every step of the way. I was also given the amazing opportunity to interview with Jill Malandrino on Nasdaq TradeTalks show.

A global pandemic did not stop the Greenwood Project from having summer internships and giving an opportunity for students to grow. They turned everything virtual and went above and beyond so the 2020 college cohort could gain as much experience in the finance industry as possible. I will be forever thankful to the Greenwood Project and Bevon Joseph because they saw something in me that I could not see in myself. I now know that I belong in these spaces and will continue to be successful in them.
