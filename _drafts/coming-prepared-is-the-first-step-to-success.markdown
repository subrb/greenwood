My name is Kevin Perkins and I am a rising Senior at Bradley University completing a Bachelor of Science degree in Social Media Marketing with a minor in Management and Leadership. At Bradley, I am involved in numerous leadership positions including treasurer and a peer mentor where I am able to assist minorities, promote marketing strategy and business and marketing development. The summer of 2020, I had the amazing opportunity to intern with The Greenwood Project and from them, I was not only offered an internship but a chance to work with eight small businesses on the South Side of Chicago.

The Greenwood Project is my first experience having an internship. I was introduced to the organization through a current scholar and I could say, this was one of the best decisions I have made. Having a marketing background, I had very little knowledge about finance, but knew that the only way I could gain experience is through experience. Throughout the summer, I participated in many workshops that covered topics that included banking and investing, basic understanding of trading,research analysis on IPOs, training on the Bloomberg Terminal, and professional etiquette. I was able to build relationships and discuss career paths with employers from some of the largest financial institutions including William Blair, Nasdaq, Option Pit, UBS, and many more. I’ve worked on bi-weekly projects presented by these firms that have exposed me to hands-on experience of what it’s like to work in different financial sectors. In addition, I accomplished a huge achievement by successfully completing courses to receive the Bloomberg Market Concepts certification.

As I am preparing to transition into my career, much like other students, I am seeking to continue strengthening my skills in the financial sector as well as gain more experience in various professions. All things considered, the Greenwood Project has presented me with a myriad of opportunities. In my experience, the Greenwood Project has improved my professional etiquette, expanded my network significantly, and matured my knowledge of the financial industry. Even though the journey isn’t finished, Bevon and the Greenwood Project have undoubtedly pushed me to work harder to achieve my goals. They motivated me even more to pursue my aspirations and continue to excel beyond expectations. Recently, I have accepted an offer to intern with TheStreet, a financial news and financial literacy website, with the help of Zev Fima and Bevon Joseph. 

No matter what background students come from, the Greenwood Project is willing to open doors and create opportunities that are unmatched for anyone. I have learned that as long as you come prepared and ready to work, Greenwood will do everything they can to put you in a position to succeed. It has been life changing and I am truly grateful.
