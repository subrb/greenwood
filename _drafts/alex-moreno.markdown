My name is Alex Moreno and I am a rising freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. During high school, I was student-athlete playing soccer and baseball, a mentor, and a translator for international students. Additionally, I also participated in the National Hispanic Institute, a leadership program. 

At Urbana, I signed up as undeclared, but after participating in the Greenwood project this summer, and seeing all the opportunities available to me in financial services, I've realized that I want to major in economics. Coming from a low-income community, all I've seen growing up were mechanics, carpenters, and gang members. A couple of my close friends did not make it all the way through high school and a major reason for that was the lack of professional individuals that we could look up to in our communities. 
 
This summer I interned with the Greenwood Project to build my social capital and to network with individuals such as CEO’s, partners, recruiters at the many firms we visited. While visiting, the interns get to experience the tasks being completed on a daily basis, although there’s always a change in the day to day tasks because the market is always moving. Being able to visit more than 20 companies in one summer is such an advantage because I got to explore different work environments and see where I can best see myself being in a couple years. I also caught a glance at all the other positions in the industry that I had no idea even existed. 
 
Joining the Greenwood Project just after graduating high school has been the best choice I could have made for my future. I cannot thank Bevon Joseph and his wife enough for introducing minority students into the financial industry because without this opportunity I would not have access to all of the people I got to network and eat with, including the Federal Reserve Bank Chairman, Charlie Evans. Being the first in my family to participate in this type of program already broke a tradition in my family and gave me the opportunity to show my younger siblings that there is no limit to the things one can do. When there is great people such as Bevon and Elois willing to help, it is our job to participate in order to get these types of positions in the industry for black and brown individuals because it is rare to land at these positions without any connections.
