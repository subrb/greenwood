My name is Jordan Brown, and I am a rising sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign double majoring in Actuarial Science and Economics. Outside of the classroom, I serve as the Vice President of a student organization meant to support Black men on campus called Men of Impact, a member of the planning committee for the annual Black and Latino Menâ€™s Summit, and as a Multicultural Advocate within University Housing.

I am a part of the 2020 cohort of Greenwood Project scholars. This experience with the Greenwood Project is my first internship, and I did not fully know what I was getting myself into when I logged in for our first day of training. After this first meeting, I was hooked and fully bought into the vision of the Greenwood Project. I sought to take advantage of every opportunity that was now within my reach, and as a result, I have grown immensely. I have improved my professionalism, collaborative skills, technical skills, and soft skills.
 Additionally, my social capital has grown as I have been able to network with prominent figures across the financial industry. For example, I was able to connect with the Managing Director of Institutional Equity Sales at Morgan Stanley, Erika Kingetsu, who then connected me with the Global Head of Systematic Advisory Sales at Morgan Stanley, Lancelot Comrie. I was able to ask him specific questions about quantitative finance and establish a fruitful relationship that I plan to maintain.

I have also been allowed to develop while tackling highly applicable projects for the companies I have been paired with through the Greenwood Project. I completed the Bloomberg Market Concepts certification, learned to program in Python, learned about different investment principles, financial instruments, and financial institutions, and attended various educational webinars throughout this summer. Project-wise, I have utilized Microsoft Excel and VBA to aggregate and analyze historical data for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Mark Sebastian, Founder of OptionPit.com, used this information to develop an options trading strategy. During the next rotation, my team and I built an investment thesis on Apple (AAPL) for the stockbroker and financial advisor, Fred Banyon. Currently, my team and I are interns at SHA Capital Partners, a senior housing investment firm. We are working under David Watkins, a General Partner and seasoned veteran of the senior housing sector of the real estate industry. This rotation has been the most rewarding, as it has shown me the impact and benefits of finance on a neighborhood and city-wide scale. My team has produced a market study around a potential investment property, interacted with local community planning departments, and conducted a demographical analysis on another potential investment property.

I am forever grateful for every experience that the Greenwood Project has afforded me, and I appreciate how Bevon and Elois Joseph, Co-Founders of the Greenwood Project, advocated for us to receive opportunities and prepared us to take full advantage of each opportunity. We are held to a high standard and expected to perform in every role we take on: from this pressure we evolve into the future of the financial industry. Thank you to Bevon and Elois Joseph, as well as to Charles Turner, Brandy Wayne, and Chris Holloway for their work to make the Greenwood Project everything that it is!
