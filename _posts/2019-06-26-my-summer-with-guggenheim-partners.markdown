I am a Junior at Washington University in St. Louis on a full-ride scholarship. I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering with a focus on Mobile app and Web Development.

I am very thankful for all the opportunities the Greenwood Project has introduced me to including my current internship at Guggenheim Partners, LLC.

As an IT Service Desk and Customer Service Intern, I am working on a database transfer project while helping other employees around the country troubleshoot technical issues.
