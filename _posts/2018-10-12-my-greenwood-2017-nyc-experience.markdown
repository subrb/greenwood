Hello, my name is Brandy Darling and I am rising junior at Connecticut College. I double major in economics and East Asian studies with a minor in applied statistics. I have a strong interest in international business and politics concerning China, in hopes of becoming the US ambassador to China.

This summer, I had the honor to be an intern with the Greenwood Project. I was selected to participate in their NYC trip to meet with the world's most prestigious firms including Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, NY Stock Exchange and more.

This [trailer ](https://youtu.be/Gt12e6Qdj5Q) is only a snippet of the impact that the Greenwood Project has had on my development as a student and a person.

THANK YOU GREENWOOD PROJECT!
