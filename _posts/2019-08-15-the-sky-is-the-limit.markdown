My name is Joi Mays and I am a rising senior at Kenwood Academy High School. I am the President of our Humanitarian Society, Cultural Appreciation club, and I am a varsity competitor for Kenwood's multi-award winning debate team. Through the Greenwood Project, I have gained more knowledge on American and overseas stock market, and I can proudly proclaim that Greenwood has allowed me to get that exposure. Through Greenwood, I gained more exposure to avenues I always thought were out of reach. 

I was part of the Greenwood Project Financial Institute Cohort, which meant that every day for six weeks, I would visit a company along with the rest of my peers. We went from Wallstreet powerhouses like Goldman Sachs to large international manufacturing companies like Panduit to powerful technology-based companies like Braintree. At each company, we were allowed to network freely with the employees, interns, and even some of the sectional leaders. For the first time, I saw the eagerness for diversity and the anticipation I had to give it.

The Greenwood project has taught me that, although there has been a large portion of people in the financial industry that do not look at me, people are dedicated to diversity and inclusion in all departments and in many companies to bring in more in people who do look like me into their industry with open arms. I now know that the sky is the only limit.
