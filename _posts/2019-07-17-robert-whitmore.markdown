During the Greenwood Project’s annual Wall Street Tour last summer, I had the chance to visit some of the premier financial institutions in the world, one of which included lunch & learn with the top executives at Nasdaq.

Now, a year later I am spending my summer at Nasdaq as a Data Analytics & Transactions Marketing Intern within the Global Information Services (GIS) department where I’ve afforded the pleasure to work both remotely from Chicago and out of the New York office. From using CMS to develop the new. nasdaq site, to creating power points that analyze data from large scale co-marketing campaigns and partnerships with Microsoft, Robinhood, and Yahoo, this role has enhanced my understanding of the way the capital markets operates.
