After visiting CME Group I got a better understanding of how the internet and technology are the main key performance indicators behind the company’s ability to continuously compete to be unique. Using technology as a primary force to foster innovation and competitiveness is what keeps CME Group as an elite competitor in the financial industry.

I’m thankful to have participated in the Greenwood Projects “Lunch and Learns” As a result of participating, I now have a better understanding that the key to achieving financial freedom is to become financially literate.
