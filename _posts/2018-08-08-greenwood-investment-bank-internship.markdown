My name is Fanita Robins. I recently graduated from Lawrence University where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Math and Economics.

This summer, I’ve had the amazing opportunity to work with the Greenwood Project which helped me land an internship at Sandler O’Neill where I worked primarily in the fixed income department shadowing the managing director, Mike Piper. At Sandler, I was able to use my strong math skills to analyze bonds and evaluate market trends. This internship has tremendously piqued my interest in pursuing a career in the financial industry.

Thanks to the Greenwood Project, not only was I able to land an internship at the leading investment bank in the area of finance, but I was also able to join the annual New York trip where we visited some of the most prestigious firms in the financial industry. The New York trip was a once in a lifetime experience that provided us with an amazing networking opportunity and valuable exposure to finance. This was my first time in New York, so the trip was a double win for me, I was able to experience the New York culture for the first time while learning all about the financial industry.

The Greenwood Project is a place where talent is paired with opportunity. In today’s world, being smart and talented is not always enough for people from underserved communities. We need someone on the inside to open the door, giving us an opportunity to show our talent and this is exactly what the Greenwood Project is doing. I am grateful for all the opportunities that the Greenwood Project has given me thus far and plan on staying involved with the program as much as possible. I’m excited for the future growth of the program and can’t wait to see it blossom!
