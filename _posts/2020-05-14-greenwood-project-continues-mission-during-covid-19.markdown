The Greenwood Project is committed to introducing minority youth to the financial industry. In a typical summer, Greenwood Project scholars would take classes, visit firms, start internships, and host other programming. To adapt to COVID-19, we started working in early March to bring all of our programming online. 

We are happy to announce that we are still offering all of our programming, simply modified to be virtual. The Greenwood Project team is setting up virtual, paid internships: Small teams will work virtually on projects assigned to them by our partner firms. In lieu of live networking events at firms, the Greenwood Project team has set up weekly Virtual Career Chats with industry professionals from a wide-variety of financial institutions. We have also developed a series of online courses (called the Greenwood Online Academy for Learning) for students to complete at their own pace ranging from topics like Interview Preparation to Programming in Python. 

We have also expanded on our typical offerings in hopes of providing even more support to students during this difficult time. We developed, in partnership with William Blair, a program to underwrite studentsâ€™ costs to prepare and test for financial industry certifications. We also made our online classes available to any student, resulting in over 100 participants in our classes. We hope that this will expose even more students to our mission, encourage more minority students to consider the finance field, and create greater interest in applying for our summer institutes and internship programs in the future.  
Simply, we are here for our students during COVID-19. They may need us, now, more than ever. The landscape of internships and hiring is more challenging now than we ever imagined. But, we are working hard to provide continued opportunities to give Greenwood Project scholars a leg up. 

We encourage all students to check out the Greenwood Online Academy for Learning and our Virtual Career Chats. For more information, email Charles at charles.turner@greenwoodproject.org. We also update our social media regularly with opportunities for anyone to become involved: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/greenwoodprochi/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/greenwoodprochi/?hl=en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/greenwoodprochi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenwood-project/).
