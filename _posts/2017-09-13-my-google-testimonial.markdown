My name is Nia Khaan. I am currently a sophomore at Cornell University majoring in Communication. Since starting my own business at 16 encouraged my interest in business through internships. This summer I was an intern at Option Pit through the Greenwood Project.

Before visiting Google, I hadn't considered a career at the company. However, after the visit, I realized how feasible a career in computer science and at Google specifically is. I have changed my major at Cornell University to incorporate computer classes, in order to enhance my technology skills. I am grateful that Google is receptive to the idea of encouraging minority students involved in STEM-related fields.
