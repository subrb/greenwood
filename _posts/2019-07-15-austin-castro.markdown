Hello, my name is Austin Castro and I am a rising junior at Indiana State University majoring in computer engineering. At Indiana State, I am an active member of the National Society of Black engineers where my interest in finance sparked when I joined
the Collegiate Entrepreneur Organization on my campus. During my membership with C.E.O, I launched a t-shirt business. It was then I realized what investing truly was.
My experience with the Greenwood Project has been astonishing. Before Greenwood, I was oblivious to the finance industry. The Greenwood project served as my gateway to financial aptitude. I currently intern for the trading firm ‘Sumo Capital’. Sumo Capital provides traders with financial resources, technical, and
compliance support. It serves as a trading hub for professional traders in Chicago. While interning with Sumo Capital I’ve been given various projects that have enhanced my programming skills, increasing my acquaintanceship with the real-world tech industry.
I also have been given the opportunity to instruct Greenwood’s first Fintech program. Greenwoods first Fintech program has put me in a position of leadership. I instruct the course in co-op with another talented Greenwood student. We designed the curriculum and created a tentative schedule for the Fintech cohort. It is an honor to be able to instruct a group of students who are extremely gifted. I was fortunate enough to be selected to attend Greenwood’s annual trip to New York where we visited over nine companies on Wall Street in five days. I am looking forward to what the rest of the summer has to offer.
