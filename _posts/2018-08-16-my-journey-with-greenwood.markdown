My name is Hayes Bynum, and I am entering my last year at the University of Iowa where I’ll be graduating next Spring with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, along with a minor in Business Administration. The past few years I've had the opportunity to gain experience in derivatives as well as accounting. This was my first summer as a member of the Greenwood Project, and it has truly been an enriching experience filled with endless connections.

The program began with a week of intense financial services training, after which I was then placed in an internship at Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG), where I have been submersed in every facet of the FCM entirely, including sessions with compliance, shadowing several proprietary traders and risk analysts, presentations from business development representatives, and much more. My favorite snapshots by far have been simulation trading on Trading Technologies, several mock trading sessions, extensive floor tours of the CBOE and CBOT, Lunch & Learn with NFA as well as CQG, and finally attending the famed John Lothian Conference.

All of the newly acquired skills and connections from both the internship and financial workshops culminated in Greenwood's annual Wall Street Tour. I was selected to participate in a series of NY Lunch & Learns hosted by some of the most prestigious financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Bloomberg among several others. Additionally, I was also provided tours of each of the major exchanges including NYSE, CME, and even NASDAQ where I interviewed on Jill Malandrino's #TradeTalks segment.

Ultimately, my experience this summer has opened my eyes to the bevy of careers within financial services and specifically confirmed my plans to pursue trading. I am greatly appreciative of both Greenwood and RCG for making this internship as seamless as possible, with every single person being very willing to connect, and extremely open to answering all questions thoroughly. I'm excited to keep learning as I look to start my career.
