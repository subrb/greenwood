Hello, my name is Darnell Glover and l am a recent graduate of DePaul University where I earned my bachelors in accountancy with a concentration in audit.

Since graduation, Iâ€™ve been working with the Greenwood Project which helped me land a full time internship at the Cboe Global Markets where I work in their internal audit department helping them translation onto a new governance, risk, and compliance automated platform, working on various audit projects, and participating in mid year risk assessment meetings.

Through Greenwood, not only was I able to land an internship at the largest options exchange in the US, but I was also able to visit and connect with some of the most prestigious firms in the financial industry during our week-long trip to New York. 

Greenwood does everything in its power to make sure its scholars succeed without asking for anything but hard work in return. Having people like this who genuinely want to see you succeed is what makes the Greenwood Project truly invaluable.

I plan to stay involved with Greenwood after the summer is over as much as possible. Whether it be mentoring the next class of scholars, or volunteering at Greenwood hosted events, I believe Greenwood is program everyone should be a part of and want to do my part to make sure Greenwood is successful!
