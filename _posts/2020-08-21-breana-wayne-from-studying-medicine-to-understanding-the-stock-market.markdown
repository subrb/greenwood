My name is Breana Wayne and I am a Junior at Bradley University double majoring in Biochemistry and Chemistry Business with a Minor in Management and Leadership. At Bradley, I am a member of the University's Student Government, President of the National Society of Leadership and Success, a starter for D1 Club Volleyball, and an active member of mixed martial arts. Outside of class, I am a medical scribe at  Unitypoint Health Methodist hospital in Peoria, IL while currently conducting research with a psychology professor.

My job as a medical scribe entails research and shadowing the physicians in the Emergency Department of the hospital, taking notes of all the patients the physician sees. The notes and observation that are created by me, are taken in the diagnosis of each individual patient. My experience being a scribe has allowed me to further my research in the medical field but my knowledge about finance was limited outside of medicine. Many times, the patients would talk about certain policies that are affecting the market and my conversation would divert away from that. I wanted to be able to have these conversations with my coworkers and family members so I asked my sister about it. My sister is a three-year alum of the Greenwood Project and is very passionate about the mission and work that Greenwood does so I wanted to learn more. 

During the summer of 2020, I joined the Greenwood Project. Greenwood has not only enhanced my communication skills, expanded my knowledge in the stock market, and increased my network. They have also allowed me to expand my network in the finance world, including, connecting with employees from William Blair, Option Pit, Group1, and more. Thanks to the Greenwood Project, I had the opportunity to learn more about Abbvie Pharmaceutical Research Development company and speak to current employees and interns for the summer of 20201. Going forward, I have two potential internships waiting for me.
