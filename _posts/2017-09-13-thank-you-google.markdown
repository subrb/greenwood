Hello, my name is Raven Byrd, and I am a recent graduate of Harold Washington Community College, where I earned my associate degree in business/economics. I'll be a Junior this fall at the University of Illinois at Chicago, majoring is accounting. My career goal is to be a Forensic Accountant.

My experience at Google exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the presentation and the tour. It was very informational and it gave me a clear insight into a few of the major departments that help keep the company afloat. It also encouraged me to look more into the tech industry and to pursue a few coding courses while in school.  Thank you Google for allowing the Greenwood Project to provide students with experiences like this.
