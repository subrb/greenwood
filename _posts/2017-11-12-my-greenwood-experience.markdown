My name is Donald Harris. I am a recent graduate of Knox College where I majored in Economics and minored in Business (with a focus in Marketing) and Sociology. In January, I will be starting my career as a credit analyst at MB Financial Bank.

This past summer, I had the honor of being a part of the Greenwood Project and through the program, I interned at Budo Group. During my time at Budo, I developed a competitive marketing analysis to help improve their marketing strategies. I also proposed various designs for the company’s website. It was great bringing my skill set to Budo but what I enjoyed most about the internship was gaining a better understanding of how a trading firm operates. From having conversations with traders to learning about the technology side of the industry, it provided me with an overall aspect of what goes on in a trading firm.

Having the opportunity to go to New York and visit the top trading firms was an unbelievable experience and something that I will forever cherish. The highlight of my trip was definitely visiting the New York Stock Exchange. I’ve always heard people talk about it, but to actually be there and see the opening bell ring is something I can’t describe. I, along with the other interns, had the chance to speak to the Thomas Farley, the President of the New York Stock Exchange, which was also an experience in itself. I realize that very few people have this opportunity so for me to be a part of this few is very humbling.

 Overall, I am very grateful to have had this remarkable experience this summer and it would not have been possible without the Greenwood Project. This program is dedicated to introducing minorities to the financial industry through internships, career development workshops, business trips, and so much more. Joining the Greenwood Project family is one of the best decisions I have made and I will continue to be an active member of the organization. I can honestly say that the future of Greenwood Project is very bright. Greenwood Project has certainly changed the trajectory of my career ambitions.
