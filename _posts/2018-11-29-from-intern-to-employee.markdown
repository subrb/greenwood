Hi, my name is Darnell Glover, and I was recently converted to a full time auditor at Cboe Global Markets from the internship position I was placed in thanks to the Greenwood Project.

Whether it was speaking confidently in front of CEOâ€™s, networking with total strangers, or embracing and overcoming new challenges, I was able to apply the skills I acquired during my time with Greenwood to my internship, in the process impressing employees and management on multiple levels through the organization.

I want to thank the Greenwood Project for helping me go from a college senior with little professional experience, to receiving a full time offer from one of the most influential exchanges in the world, in just a matter of months!
