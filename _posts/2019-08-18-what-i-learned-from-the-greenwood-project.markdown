My name is Kwintyn Essex and I am a rising Senior at Eisenhower High School. I am a Link Unlimited Scholar and an Assistant Instructor at a Martial Arts School. This summer, I have participated in the Greenwood Project's FinTech  Cohort. I wanted to get a basic understanding of code in case I wanted to further my knowledge for a career choice later in life and I believed a summer interning for an organization that thrived in introducing students into the finance and technology world would be the best access to that. I have always been interested in science and technology and this program helped me realized that I could explore my interest while I am in high school.

This Summer at the Greenwood Project, I was introduced to the coding language of Python. I learned basic coding terminology and learned how to create a program to track my banking spending. Besides learning to code, the Greenwood Project brought me to many different companies to learn about Finance. I was able to network and learn about the finance world that I would have never known before. I learned a lot at the Greenwood Project, but one of the most important things I learned that I can always take with me is my elevator pitch.

All in all, Greenwood has been an enlightening experience that I will always remember. Greenwood has opened doors for me, but it is my job to step through them. Greenwood has given me a new perspective on the finance world and is an all-around great program. I hope to further my knowledge of coding and how I could use my knowledge of programming in the finance world.
