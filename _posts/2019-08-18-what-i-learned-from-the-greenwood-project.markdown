My name is Kwintyn Essex and I am a rising Senior at Eisenhower High School. I am a Link Unlimited Scholar and an Assistant Instructor at a Martial Arts School. This summer, I participated in the Greenwood Project's FinTech  Cohort. I wanted to get a basic understanding of coding in case I wanted to further my knowledge for a career choice later in life, and I believed a summer interning for an organization that thrived in introducing students into the finance and technology world would be the best way to do that. I have always been interested in science and technology, and this program helped me realized that I could explore my interest even though I am in high school.

This Summer at the Greenwood Project, I was introduced to the coding language of Python. I learned basic coding terminology and learned how to create a program to track my spending. Besides learning to code, the Greenwood Project took me to many different companies to learn about finance careers. I was able to network and learn about the finance world which is something I would have never been exposed to if not for the Greenwood Project. I learned a lot at the Greenwood Project, but one of the most important things I learned that I can always take with me is my elevator pitch.

All in all, Greenwood has been an enlightening experience that I will always remember. Greenwood has opened doors for me, but it is my job to step through them. Greenwood has given me a new perspective on the finance world and is an all-around great program. I hope to further my knowledge of coding and continue to explore the many ways I could use this knowledge of programming in the finance world.
