My name is Miguel Gomez and I am a rising senior at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. I am an Economics Major who has always had an interest to work within the financial
industry. The biggest challenge that I faced through my college career was not having the
network and support to be introduced into that industry. I met Bevon Joseph through a
colleague of mine who was a member of the Greenwood Projects Class of 2018. When I sat
down to interview with Bevon I realized that I was not the only student who was facing this
problem. I am a minority who has never been exposed to the world of Financial services. Here
was an organization that was started by Bevon and his wife Eloise who both have had
numerous amounts of successful years in this industry and are dedicating their time, capital and
life to ensuring that students like myself are given the opportunity to not only experience
Financial services through internships but more importantly to help us create secure and
successful futures for ourselves.
This summer thanks to Bevon and Eloise I am an intern at Matrix Execution Technology
where I am learning about the execution side of trading. I work very closely with my mentors at
Matrix and have been given many opportunities to challenge myself and step out of my comfort
zone. A day to day for me includes performing tasks related to Exchange research such as
researching price protections, order types, fee schedules and fix specifications that the various
exchange partners we had offered.I also had the opportunity to work both independently and
with various team members on Salesforce integration into the company. The most amazing
experience for me was the open arms that this company took me in with. I can ask anyone for
help and can turn to anyone to simply pick their brain about their day to day. The amount of
support from both my Mentors and other staff members really helps create a productive and
positive work environment.
The biggest thing that should be taken away from this is that without the Greenwood
Project this opportunity would have never become reality. Now donâ€™t get me wrong there is
plenty of work that is required of us as Greenwood Scholars and that work really does help
develop us into motivated, hardworking individuals. I will forever be thankful for the Greenwood
Project, the amazing mentors I have met and the greenwood Scholars class of 2019 who I will
continue to look at as family for the rest of my life.
