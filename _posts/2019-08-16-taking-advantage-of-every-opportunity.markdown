My name is Emmanuella Nwokenkwo and I am a recent graduate of Thornwood High School. While at Thornwood, I was a student-athlete for 3 years playing volleyball, National Honors Society member, and Vice president of Student Council. I will be attending the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the fall majoring in Business Finance. This summer, I interned with the Greenwood Project to learn more about the financial industry and build my social capital by networking with different people from various companies we visited. This summer I was able to attend 20 plus companies that range from investment banking to FinTech affiliated companies. I learned so much about the different careers incorporated in the financial industry. I went from having 0 connections on LinkedIn to 105 connections. Going into the program I was only aware of a financial advisor, the Greenwood project has exposed me to asset management, private wealth management, portfolio management, and many other careers that have given more options and fields to explore in the future. Learning about the different work styles of each career has given me an insight into what I want to do in the future.

During the program, the high school cohort was split into two groups to pitch a stock to potential investors. I have been learning a lot about what to look for in a stock, keeping up with current news, and overall understanding the literacy. Due to the Greenwood project I am currently investing in 3 stocks through the Robinhood App. 

I had no knowledge of investing prior to coming into the program and leaving with 3 stocks in investments proves knowledge the program provides. Besides of the recent knowledge I learned from the Greenwood Project about investing, I also grew my relationship with employees from two companies we visited for a Lunch and Learn, Goldman Sachs and IDEX for potential internship opportunities in the future. These are companies that I never thought I would be given the opportunity to work at because of the lack of people like me in the industry. 

Being apart of Greenwood has opened my eyes to unlimited opportunities and has given me hope that someone like me can strive in this industry. The opportunities Greenwood has exposed me to is unmatched and still till this day feels unreal. I cannot thank Bevon and Elois enough for this amazing opportunity to be apart of the Greenwood Project. Greenwood has opened many doors and now it's up to me to take advantage of those opportunities and make the most of it. Each lunch and learn we had to prepare complex questions which not only challenge my knowledge but it prepared me to understand the functions of each company. Overall, Greenwood has exposed me to many opportunities in the financial industry and I hope one day I can give back and make an impact on someone's life the way Greenwood made on mine.
