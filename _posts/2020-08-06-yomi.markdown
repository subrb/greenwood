My name is Yomileigh Abdi, but everyone calls me Yomi. I am a rising senior at Northside College Prep where I am the Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper and a member of two student organizations: Mu Alpha Theta and Economics and Investment Club. This summer, I am continuing my political science research internship and taking a finance class at Northwestern University as well as interning at the Greenwood Project Financial Institute.

I first heard about Greenwood through my AP Microeconomics teacher who posted the link on our Google Classroom page, and I was excited about the opportunity to explore the financial industry with like-minded individuals who looked like me. I wanted to learn about career paths in the financial sector and broaden my professional circle.

Through the Greenwood Project, I was invited to work on two very exciting projects. The first is collaborating with a team of 5 college students to create a combined marketing plan for 8 small black-owned businesses in Bronzeville through the Quad Communities Development Corporation (QCDC) with the assistance of Marcus Lemonis. The second is working on a feasibility study for William Blair to vet and develop a concept paper on how to build a pipeline of minority high school students for financial services.

I’m incredibly grateful for my experience at the Greenwood Project as it has been a truly worthwhile summer. The exposure has made me much more knowledgeable about the stock market, investing and other financial concepts that initially seemed esoteric. Every morning, I’ve started reading an Investopedia newsletter that summarizes the key headlines and insights of the global markets. It’s a small step but it allows me to slowly build my understanding with daily doses of current financial information in my inbox. I’m interested in attending an undergraduate business school and majoring in economics with a concentration in finance. My time at Greenwood has made me much more confident about my ability to succeed as a business major and a black woman in the financial industry.
