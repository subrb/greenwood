My name is Yomileigh Abdi, but everyone calls me Yomi. I am a rising Senior at Northside College Prep where I am the Editor-in-Chief of the schools newspaper, a member of the Math Honor Society and a member of the Economics and Investment Club. This summer, I am continuing my research internship with Northwestern University where I assist a Political Science professor as well as taking a finance course to prepare me for college, and interning with the Greenwood Project.

This is my first year with the Greenwood Project Financial Institute and it has been truly a worthwhile summer. I first learned about Greenwood through my AP Microeconomics teacher who posted the link on our Google Classroom page, and I was excited about the opportunity to explore the financial industry with like-minded individuals who looked like me. I joined the Greenwood Project because I wanted to learn about career paths in the financial sector and broaden my professional circle.

Through the Greenwood Project, I was invited to work on two very exciting projects. The first is collaborating with a team of 5 college students to create a combined marketing plan for 8 small black-owned businesses in Bronzeville through the Quad Communities Development Corporation (QCDC) with the assistance of Marcus Lemonis. The second is working on a feasibility study for William Blair to vet and develop a concept paper on how to build a pipeline of minority high school students for financial services.

I’m incredibly grateful for my experience at the Greenwood Project. The exposure has made me much more knowledgeable about the stock market, investing and other financial concepts that initially seemed esoteric. Every morning, I’ve started reading an Investopedia newsletter that summarizes the key headlines and insights of the global markets. It’s a small step but it allows me to slowly build my understanding and comprehension with daily doses of current financial information in my inbox. I am interested in continuing my education on the east coast, majoring in Finance with a focus in Economics and a minor in Political Science. Thanks to the Greenwood Project, I now have the confidence that I have the ability to succeed as a business major and black woman in the financial industry.
