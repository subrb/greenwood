Hello, my name is Cornell Horne Jr, I am a rising senior at Westinghouse College Prep studying engineering. I have participated in multiple sports, clubs and other extracurricular activities at school. I am a member of the National Honor Society, and currently a nominee of the POSSE scholarship. After my high-school journey is complete, I plan to pursue the path of both Finance and Engineering. 

This summer, I have been blessed to become one of the students that were apart of the Greenwood Project 6-week Boot Camp. During the program, I was able to gain an understanding regarding stocks, bonds, balance sheets, 10K’s, 10Q’s, and learned various analytical techniques and equations to use when evaluating the performance of a company. I learned to calculate Net Present Value (NPV), Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Additionally, while participating in the Lunch & Learn series, my professional etiquette grew as we visited 10 of some of the top financial & tech firms such as Google, Salesforce, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Sandler O'Neill, and a few others.

The Lunch & Learn meetings with these companies gave me the opportunity to connect with the top executives and directors from various lines of business. On the days that we were not visiting companies, I was in the classroom at DePaul University implementing my knowledge on company valuation, balance sheets, and 10K’s into my team’s final project & presentation. My group’s presentation focused on analyzing & researching the microprocessing company, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

On the final day during “Greenwood’s 2018 Closing Ceremony” at the UBS Tower, my team pitched “Why You Should You Invest In AMD” in a Shark Tank type competition where we tied for 1st place, competing with teams who selected Netflix, Amazon, and Disney as there companies.
