The finance industry is male-dominated, so we launched a Women of Wall Street (W.O.W.) speaking series to show our female students as many success stories as possible.

Past W.O.W events were hosted by Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) & Cboe Global Markets.

Due to the popularity of our W.O.W events, we are now partnering with companies in other industries such as technology.

The event open to High School and College students.

W.O.W DETAILS

W.O.W events provide students with the opportunity to hear the current voice of women on Wall Street. Representing a variety of ages and experience, representatives from various companies share their stories of triumphs and tribulations as they negotiated their careers as women in business.
