The finance industry is male-dominated, so Greenwood launched a Women of Wall Street (W.O.W.) speaking series in 2016 to show our female students as many success stories as possible. W.O.W events provide students with the opportunity to hear the current voice of women on Wall Street. Representing a variety of ages and experience, representatives from various companies share their stories of triumphs and tribulations as they negotiated their careers as women in business. Past W.O.W events were hosted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME) & Cboe Global Markets. Due to the popularity of our W.O.W events, we are now partnering with companies in other industries such as Tech. The event is open to High School and College students.
