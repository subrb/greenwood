The finance industry is male-dominated, so Greenwood Project launched a Women of Wall Street (W.O.W.) speaking series in 2016 to show our female students' as many success stories as possible about women who have broken the glass ceiling in the finance industry. Representing a variety of ages and experience, representatives from various companies share their stories of triumphs and tribulations as they negotiated their careers as women in business. Past W.O.W events were hosted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) & Cboe Global Markets. Our 5th W.O.W. will be hosted by Cboe Global Markets with a panel from William Blair, Alaina Anderson, Business First AM Angela Miles, Northwestern Mutual, Jacqui Coleman, Blueleaf.com, Colleen Wilson, Futures Compliance Inc, Cheryl Fitzpatrick, and a three scholar of Greenwood Project and intern at ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago, Journee Lockridge. The event is open to High School, College, and recent graduate students.
