My name is Jonathan Hernandez and I am a rising junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Agriculture and Consumer Economics with a Concentration in Financial Planning. Before I was introduced to the Greenwood Project, I did not know what I wanted to do with my major and how my interest in the finance industry at entry-level was going to help me. Coming from a background where my family and friends are not in the finance industry, it made it very difficult to learn about the finance industry and even more difficult to land an internship. After hearing about the Greenwood Project from a friend at my University, I eagerly reached out to Bevon, the co-founder of the organization, to learn more about the Greenwood Project. When I was accepted into the program, I made it a priority to put my best foot forward in everything I did. All I can say is that it was the best step I have ever made in my life. Thanks to the Greenwood Project, I have learned more about the financial industry with an expanded knowledge of financial literacy that has opened doors for my career path in the future.

Through the Greenwood Project, I am interning at Oak Street Real Estate Capital, one of the largest private equity real estate firms, where I am creating financial models, offering memorandums, and learning how to develop client business relationships. Not only did Greenwood provide me with an amazing internship and guidance, but they also choose me, along with 12 other scholars, to fly out to New York City and experience the life of an employee on both the buy and sell-side.

Yes, the Greenwood Project has been a great experience in regards to the finance industry, but most importantly, they provided me a support system for my education, for my career and as a long-term mentor.  Knowing that I have a group of like-minded and supportive peers and mentors, has given me the ultimate confidence that my dreams can become a reality.
