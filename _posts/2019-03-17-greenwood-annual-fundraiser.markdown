As you know, the Greenwood Project makes an impact by introducing academically ambitious minority students to the financial industry. In just under four years we have exposed close to 400 students (HS & College) to possible careers in the financial industry. The Greenwood Project model works! As a result of our programs, our college grads continue to receive employment offers after completion of their internship. It truly takes a village to do this work, and we thank all our partners for their support over the last three years.

We are asking for your support with our upcoming fundraiser. Each year in an effort to raise money to help us meet our financial goals, we host this event. This yearâ€™s fundraiser will be held on Friday, April 12, 2019, at the Rooftop on theWit. We expect a great turnout, but more importantly, this will be a night of community. The funds raised from this event support our Summer Internship Program, Lunch & Learn Events, Women of Wall Street Speaking Series, New York Wall Street Tour, High School Summer Program, and career readiness workshops. Many of our scholars will be in attendance so you will have to the opportunity to hear from them directly.
