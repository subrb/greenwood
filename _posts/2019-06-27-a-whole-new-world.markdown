My name is Kurstyn Thompson and I am a Southside Chicago Native. I am also a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communications as well as a Certificate in Cultures & Communications. At Wisconsin-Milwaukee, I was the President of my Chapter, Kappa Eta, of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc while also being the Regional Program, Planning, and Development Co-Chair. I graduated with a 3.53, Cum Laude, and on the Deans List.

Currently, I am the Social Media Intern at Goldman Sachs under the 10,000 small businesses. I am learning a lot about the financial services industry in relation to communication and media. I have had the privilege to work with the Wynnerâ€™s Club, a social media event marketing and promotion company, through Goldman Sachs thanks to the Greenwood Project. Every day, I am tasked with something different and I have been able to learn new things at an exponential rate. I have been trusted to make sponsorship packets, company marketing strategies, and run the social media pages for both companies. Greenwood Project has truly been a blessing. I am exposed to what feels like a whole new world and it is because of the opportunity they have given me. I never knew how much of a role Communications played in the financial services industry, but I do now. That is all thanks to Bevon and the Greenwood Project team!
