My name is Journee Lockridge, and I am a senior at Gwendolyn Brooks high school. I am President of the National Honor Society at my school, Recipient of the Chicago Cubs Scholars Scholarship, and was crowned Miss Teen Diva 2016 from a Chicago local pageant. I am very interested in studying business at either Howard University, Princeton University, or UCLA.

Pillar Insurance was an amazing internship experience. I had my own desk, computer, and phone. I had the responsibility of making payments for customers, I was able to help resolve policy conflicts, and I was able to create auto insurance quotes. My most memorable moment at Pillar is making my first payment for a customer. It took me some time to get used to answering the phone and working with the systems, but once I figured it out, I felt so accomplished and valuable to Pillar. 

Maurice, the founder of Pillar Insurance, has shown me what it takes to successfully run a business and the importance of staying one step ahead in business.

At Pillar Insurance, I learned what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. My experiences at Pillar have increased my love for business, and have inspired me to work harder to achieve success in the industry. I hope to continue learning about both entrepreneurship and finance in college. I will be sure to take all of my notes and words of wisdom with me on my journey into the business world.
