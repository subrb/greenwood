My name is Leslie Esquivel and I am a rising Senior at John Hancock College Preparatory with a passion for math and technology. After taking multiple computer science courses and my summer with the Greenwood Project, I aspire to pursue a career in the engineering field, particularly Computer Science.

My school only has a limited amount of computer science classes, thus while searching for a larger opportunity to help advance my knowledge and skills in computer science and its languages, a classmate recommended me to research the Greenwood Project. After learning the mission of the Greenwood Project and about their Fintech track for high school students,  I was determined to get into their Fintech Internship. I was ecstatic the moment I received the news that I had been accepted and regardless of the pandemic, the Greenwood Project would continue virtually. 

Greenwood has opened various different opportunities for me. I began my internship this summer with only the knowledge of one programming language, JavaScript, and left knowing 2 additional languages, Python and R. I am able to apply these languages in my career to solve financial problems such as  the analysis of stocks. The Greenwood Project also demonstrated the importance of an adequate resume and professional etiquette, leading me to create an outstanding resume after various workshops.

Not only did I gain knowledge in computer science languages, I was also introduced into the world of finance. I entered with a minimal knowledge on stocks and investing and managed to understand the importance of analyzing stocks, as well as different forms of investing. I learned about careers in which both finance and computer science are combined allowing me to understand all the opportunities that are truly available for me once I earn my degree in college. 

Finally, I am ended my summer with strong principles that would not have been possible without Greenwood. Regardless of the situation I am in, and regardless of the people around me, I can be successful as long as I remain motivated, confident, and driven that I will succeed in my chosen field. I am thankful for all the career talk speakers for elaborating these principals and especially Bevon Joseph, the President of Greenwood, for creating and allowing me to participate in this amazing opportunity.
