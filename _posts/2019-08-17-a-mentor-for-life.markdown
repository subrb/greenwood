My name is Miciah Sanders and I am a rising Senior at the University of Chicago Charter School.  I am a Posse Scholar nominee and volleyball manager. I have done Girls Who Code for 3 years where I learned computer programs such as CSS, Javascript, and HTML. I have also been in Lego Robotics where I build Robots and programmed them from Legos. Because of these experiences, I want to major in Computer Science when I go to college. This is my second year with the Greenwood Project and I have used this opportunity to get more exposure and meet more people in STEM.

	With Greenwood, I have visited 27 companies including UBS, Braintree, Northwestern Mutual, William Blair, IDEX, and more. I have made great connections at many of our company visits, Learned about the company and their importance to communities and internal mission for sustainability. Each lunch and learn was different and inspiring. Every company showed its support toward what the Greenwood Project stands for. For example, At William Blair about 25 employees came to the event to meet us, share their knowledge and give advice on how we could join their team or grow as the person we are now.  
            With the Greenwood Project I have learned great soft skills, connections within our group. The peer mentors gave amazing support and advice and I even gained a mentor through the Greenwood Project. While preparing for the stock pitch competition they gave the advice to improve individually and as a group. I am very grateful to have another awesome experience with the Greenwood Project this summer. I appreciate the exposure given because without I would not have known much about the financial industry.
