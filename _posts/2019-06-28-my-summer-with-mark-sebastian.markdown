My name is Amber Toussaint and I am a recent graduate of Malcolm X College, a city college of Chicago and am continuing my education at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Energy. Furthermore, I am an NJCAA Academic All-American athlete and recent CME Mayoral Scholarship recipient. This summer, through the Greenwood Project, I have had the opportunity of interning at Option Pit under Mark Sebastian. 

This internship has exposed me to the financial services industry where I have contributed to the rebranding of Option Pit. Enhancing the way people can utilize options trading courses, making their product more inclusive. My responsibilities are similar to working for a business startup. As a result of my progress this summer, I have been chosen to represent Greenwood on their annual New York trip to Wall Street. Greenwood has allowed students like myself to flourish in environments where we are the minority, making lasting impressions for future internship opportunities. This program has already immersed me into a community of financial experts, New York is just the second phase of this rewarding experience.
