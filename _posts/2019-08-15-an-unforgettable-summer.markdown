My name is Joshua Thornton, and I am a rising senior at De La Salle Institute. While at De La Salle, I am the Captain of our Menâ€™s Varsity Basketball Team, an avid member of the Investment Club, Treasurer of the French Club and a National Honors Society Member. When I attend college, I plan on majoring in Business Finance and minoring in Accounting. This past summer, the Greenwood Project has helped me get connections in both fields. 

   While at Greenwood, I am in the high school Financial Institue Cohort. During the week, we attend Lunch and Learns, visiting different financial companies such as Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Partners, Panduit, and William Blair. We also compete in a stock pitch competition. In the stock pitch competition, the two high school cohort groups are separated into teams to research one stock to pitch to investors (shark tank style). My group chose Alibaba, where we place 1st place in the competition. During our analzyzation of Alibaba, we research everything we learned about The Market in Greenwood and apploed it to our PowerPoint and our group peformance.

   Overall, the Greenwood project has made a huge impact on me. My dad worked in the financial services industry for over 20 years as a Portfolio Manager for BMO Harris Bank, so coming into Greenwood, I was already somewhat familiar with the workings of the financial industry. Nevertheless, the connections I was able to make because of the Greenwood project are second to none. I started with 0 connections on LinkedIn and am now approaching 90; all gained in 6 weeks. The friends I made with my peers in the program and the experiences I shared with them I truly will never forget. Greenwood is a great project with an even greater mission, and it certainly has lived up to its reputation for me. I can only thank them for all the opportunities they have given me.
