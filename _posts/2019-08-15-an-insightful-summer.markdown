My name is Jeremy Glasper and I am a recent graduate of Marian Catholic High School. I am also a Link Unlimited alum. During my senior at Marian, I was the lead designer for the robotics club. Through teamwork and leadership, we were able to place first at a local VEXrobotics drone competition. In the fall I will be attending Bradley University where I plan to major in mechanical engineering with a concentration in Biomedical Science. After undergrad, I would like to pursue a masters in mechanical engineering with aspirations of opening my own firm. This summer I interned at the Greenwood Project in order to learn how personal finance and the stock market to help innovate technology. Before interning at the Greenwood Project, I had never heard about investment banking or brokerage accounts.

I was willing to learn because I wanted to invest my money wisely in the future but neither my family or teachers could break it down to terms I could understand. During the first week at Greenwood, Bevon and the College Cohort exposed us to the field of finance by listing careers and having us research them. The research we did also prepared us for lunch and learns with diverse companies. Since I plan on majoring in Engineering, I geared my questions towards technology. The extensive preparation paid off immensely because companies could tell that we did our homework. This further translated into serious job opportunities for myself and other Greenwood scholars. The financial field is constantly changing and becoming more technological. These changes allow engineers like myself the opportunity to work closely in the field of finance. Iâ€™m
very grateful for the GreenWood Project because they gave me early exposure to my career. The relationships and networking skills I have learned while at the Greenwood Project have completely changed the way I view finance.
